# Skeleton node reference

Start with the [skeleton workflow tutorial](../workflows/skeleton-network-analysis.md)
to choose 2D or 3D processing and inspect your segmentation. This page lists the
outputs, units, and assumptions needed to interpret the resulting tables.

## Skeletonize

- **Input:** binary mask.
- **Output:** binary skeleton mask.
- **Purpose:** Converts foreground objects into one-pixel/voxel-wide
  centerlines.
- **Spatial processing:** `3D ZYX` thins each complete ZYX volume once. Leading
  non-spatial axes are independent blocks, so `TZYX` runs one ZYX volume per
  timepoint. `2D YX` thins each YX plane independently.
- **Auto from axes:** explicit `ZYX` selects volumetric 3D processing and
  explicit `YX` selects 2D processing. A generic `QYX` stack is ambiguous and
  is rejected until Image Source records a reviewed declaration such as
  `QYX -> ZYX`, or the user deliberately chooses `2D YX`.
- **Methods:** `Auto` resolves deterministically to Lee for 3D and Zhang for
  2D. Lee is valid for 2D and 3D. `Zhang 2D` is never valid for a 3D block,
  including an empty volume.
- **Algorithm contract:** the 3D path uses scikit-image's implementation of the
  Lee, Kashyap, and Chu volumetric thinning algorithm. Lee examines a 3x3x3
  neighbourhood and rechecks deletion candidates to preserve connectivity.
  Each processed block is surrounded by background at its boundary. The
  output preserves input shape, axis records, calibration, and leading-axis
  identity.
- **Provenance:** the output metadata history records the actual Lee or Zhang
  method, resolved 2D/3D block scope, neighbourhood, and boundary assumption.
- **Use before:** `Analyze Skeleton`, `Measure Skeleton Branches`, `Skeleton
  Keypoints`, `Skeleton Graph Overlay`, `Label Skeleton Components`, `Label
  Skeleton Branches`, and `Prune Skeleton Branches`.

The Lee implementation follows T.-C. Lee, R. L. Kashyap, and C.-N. Chu,
"Building skeleton models via 3-D medial surface/axis thinning algorithms",
*Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing* 56(6), 1994. VIPP currently
pins scikit-image 0.26.0 in its supported Python 3.12 application environments.

## Orthogonal 3D Skeleton QC

Use this small comparison before relying on a new volumetric segmentation:

1. Send the same explicit ZYX binary mask to two `Skeletonize` nodes. Set one
   to `3D ZYX` with `Lee` and the other to `2D YX` with `Auto`.
2. Inspect the source mask and both skeleton outputs in XY, XZ, and YZ views.
   A true 3D centerline should remain connected while it curves or branches
   through Z. A slice-wise result often appears plausible in XY but becomes a
   ribbon, a set of parallel paths, or disconnected fragments in XZ/YZ.
3. Connect each result to `Skeleton Keypoints` or `Skeleton Graph Overlay` and
   compare endpoints and junctions in all three orientations.
4. Connect each result to `Analyze Skeleton`. Review component, endpoint,
   junction, branch, and cycle counts. Large changes between the two modes are
   evidence that the spatial-processing choice materially affects network
   topology.
5. Keep `3D ZYX` only when Z is an explicitly declared spatial axis. For an
   anisotropic volume, set the Z/Y/X calibration before interpreting physical
   branch lengths.

## Analyze Skeleton

- **Input:** skeleton mask, or a binary mask if `Input` is set to `Skeletonize
  first`.
- **Output:** table, one row per connected skeleton component.
- **Purpose:** Measures whole-network/component properties.
- **Reports:** skeleton voxel count, endpoint voxels, junction voxels, isolated
  nodes, branch count, graph node/edge counts, voxel-graph edge count, cycle
  count, component context, and skeleton length in pixel/voxel units plus
  physical units when scale metadata is available.
- **Execution:** manual/cached. Use `Calculate` or enable `Auto Recalculate`
  for small data.

## Measure Skeleton Branches

- **Input:** skeleton mask, or a binary mask if `Input` is set to `Skeletonize
  first`.
- **Output:** table, one row per traced graph branch.
- **Purpose:** Measures individual branches between graph nodes.
- **Reports:** component ID, branch ID, branch type, voxel count, graph-edge
  count, branch length, endpoint-to-endpoint distance, tortuosity, start/end
  coordinates, and calibrated physical length when scale metadata is available.
- **Execution:** manual/cached. This can produce many rows on dense networks.

## Summarize Skeleton Branches

- **Input:** a table from `Measure Skeleton Branches`.
- **Output:** table, one row per grouping block. Auto grouping preserves useful
  context columns such as source, time, channel, and spatial block indices.
- **Purpose:** Converts row-per-branch measurements into compact distributions
  suitable for treatment comparison, PCA-style feature extraction, and network
  QC.
- **Reports:** branch count, component count, total branch length, selectable
  length and tortuosity statistics, and branch-type counts/fractions such as
  endpoint-to-junction or junction-to-junction fractions.
- **Use when:** you want table-derived branch distributions without manually
  configuring the generic `Summarize Measurements` node.

## Skeleton Graph Tables

- **Input:** skeleton mask, or a binary mask if `Input` is set to `Skeletonize
  first`.
- **Output:** two table outputs: graph nodes and graph edges.
- **Purpose:** Exports the explicit graph representation for downstream network
  analysis, plotting, or external graph tools.
- **Node table reports:** component ID, graph node ID, node type, node degree,
  skeleton voxel index, and spatial coordinates.
- **Edge table reports:** component ID, edge ID, start/end node IDs, branch
  type, branch voxel count, branch edge count, path length, endpoint distance,
  tortuosity, start/end coordinates, and calibrated physical length when scale
  metadata is available.
- **Execution:** manual/cached. This is the most direct table export of the
  skeleton graph.

## Measure Overall Skeleton Network

- **Input:** skeleton mask, or a binary mask if `Input` is set to `Skeletonize
  first`.
- **Output:** table, one row per analyzed spatial block, such as one image,
  timepoint, channel, or slice depending on spatial processing.
- **Purpose:** Measures whole-network topology directly from the skeleton mask.
  This is not just a table summary of `Measure Skeleton Branches`; it computes
  component-level and graph-level metrics that require the original skeleton
  graph.
- **Reports:** component count, skeleton voxel count, largest-component
  fraction, isolated component count, endpoint/junction/isolated-node counts,
  branch and graph-edge counts, cycle count, total skeleton length, branch
  length summaries, mean tortuosity, connectedness fraction, and fragmentation
  index. It also reports normalized connectedness features such as isolated
  component fraction, branches/endpoints/junctions/cycles per component, and
  components/branches/endpoints/junctions/cycles per skeleton length or
  calibrated physical length when available.
- **Use when:** you want one compact feature row per image, timepoint, channel,
  or other spatial block for treatment comparison, PCA-style analysis, or
  mitochondrial connectedness QC.
- **Execution:** manual/cached.

Use `Measure Skeleton Branches -> Summarize Skeleton Branches` when you want
branch-length distributions and branch-type fractions grouped by image,
timepoint, channel, condition, or branch type. Use the generic `Summarize
Measurements` node only when you need custom statistics on arbitrary table
columns. Use `Measure Overall Skeleton Network` when you need network-level
quantities such as connected components, cycles, isolated nodes,
largest-component fraction, and normalized connectedness metrics.

## Skeleton Keypoints

- **Input:** skeleton mask.
- **Output:** three mask outputs: endpoints, junctions, and isolated nodes.
- **Purpose:** Visual QC of graph topology.
- **Use when:** you need to check whether a segmentation/skeletonization step is
  creating too many breaks, junctions, or isolated fragments.

## Skeleton Graph Overlay

- **Input:** skeleton mask.
- **Output:** channel-last RGB image.
- **Purpose:** Visual QC overlay for graph topology in napari.
- **Display modes:** colored edges with colored nodes, colored edges only, or
  white edges with colored nodes.
- **Node colors:** endpoints are green, junctions are magenta, and isolated
  nodes are cyan/blue.
- **Use when:** you want graph branches and nodes to be visually obvious. 2D
  overlays display as one RGB image layer; 3D overlays display as separate
  additive red/green/blue layers so napari can render the colors reliably.

## Label Skeleton Components

- **Input:** skeleton mask.
- **Output:** label image.
- **Purpose:** Assigns a label ID to each connected skeleton component.
- **Use when:** you need to inspect or count disconnected skeleton networks.

## Label Skeleton Branches

- **Input:** skeleton mask.
- **Output:** label image.
- **Purpose:** Assigns label IDs to branch paths between graph nodes.
- **Use when:** you need an inspectable branch map rather than a table.
- **Note:** Junction voxels are deliberately not assigned to branch labels so
  connected branch paths remain visually separable.

## Prune Skeleton Branches

- **Input:** skeleton mask.
- **Output:** binary skeleton mask.
- **Purpose:** Removes short terminal spurs and optional isolated skeleton
  voxels.
- **Key settings:** minimum terminal branch length, length units
  (`Pixels/voxels` or `Physical units`), pruning passes, isolated-voxel removal,
  and 2D/3D spatial processing.
- **Use when:** thresholding or skeletonization creates small terminal artifacts
  that inflate endpoint and branch counts.
- **Physical units:** require pixel-size/axis-scale metadata. If no calibration
  exists, physical-unit pruning behaves like unit spacing.

## Interpreting Graph Terms

- **Endpoint:** skeleton voxel/pixel with one graph neighbor.
- **Junction:** skeleton voxel/pixel with three or more graph neighbors.
- **Isolated node:** foreground skeleton voxel/pixel with no graph neighbors.
- **Branch:** path between two graph nodes, usually endpoint-to-junction,
  junction-to-junction, endpoint-to-endpoint, or a cycle.
- **Tortuosity:** branch path length divided by endpoint-to-endpoint distance.
  A straight branch has tortuosity near 1.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not feed a thick binary mask into branch-label or keypoint nodes unless you
  intentionally want graph analysis on the thick mask. Usually run
  `Skeletonize` first.
- For anisotropic 3D data, set pixel size / units before measurement so physical
  length columns use the correct z spacing.
- For slice-wise analysis of a stack, explicitly use 2D spatial processing. For
  true volumetric connectedness, use 3D spatial processing.
- If the graph has many tiny branches, inspect the segmentation first, then try
  `Fill Holes`, `Remove Small Objects`, or `Prune Skeleton Branches`.
